/*
Given a string S, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example
Example 1:

Input: S = "eceba" and k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: T = "eceb"
Example 2:

Input: S = "WORLD" and k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: T = "WORL" or "ORLD"

/*
i - str and k
o - number that indicates the longest substring with k distinct characters
c - N/A
e - empty string / k is larger than str length
